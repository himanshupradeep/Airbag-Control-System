# Airbag-Control-System
This CANoe-based project models the behavior of an automotive airbag deployment system in response to a simulated crash event. It showcases a full simulation environment, including CAN database design, virtual dashboard panel, CAPL scripting, and realistic vehicle dynamics to emulate crash logic and safety mechanisms.
