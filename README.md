# üõ°Ô∏è Airbag Deployment System ‚Äì CANoe Simulation

This CANoe-based project models the behavior of an automotive airbag deployment system in response to a simulated crash event. It showcases a full simulation environment, including CAN database design, virtual dashboard panel, CAPL scripting, and realistic vehicle dynamics to emulate crash logic and safety mechanisms.

##  What is an Airbag System?
![Screenshot 2025-06-22 010600](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df4f48e6-99f8-437c-95b0-a0ae96cc36e8)


An airbag system is a passive vehicle safety feature designed to rapidly inflate during a collision. It provides a cushioning effect that reduces the risk of severe injuries by absorbing the force of impact. Airbags are typically triggered by electronic crash sensors that detect sudden deceleration or impact forces.

##  Advantages of Airbag Systems

- **Reduces the likelihood of critical injuries** during collisions by cushioning the head and chest.
- **Deploys automatically and rapidly**, minimizing the need for user action in emergencies.
- **Improves vehicle safety ratings**, meeting legal requirements and boosting consumer confidence.

---

##  Why Passenger Airbags Can Be Turned Off

- **To ensure the safety of children** or infants in rear-facing child seats, which could be harmed by airbag force.
- **When the passenger seat is unoccupied or detects a lightweight occupant**, to prevent unnecessary deployment and reduce maintenance costs.

##  System Behavior ‚Äì How This Simulation Works

![ScreenRecording2025-06-22004825-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53cc4b52-87eb-46f9-860d-2fa07afa96b2)


This simulation reflects realistic airbag behavior with CAN-based messaging and logic flow:

1. **Engine Start**: Vehicle system is initialized with ignition signal ON.  
2. **Gear Engagement**: Car is shifted into forward gear to signal intent to move.  
3. **Stationary State**:  
   - Seatbelt warning light is ON.  
   - Central locking dashboard indicator is ON.  
4. **Speed Threshold Reached**:  
   - At 20 km/h, speed-sensitive locking activates.  
   - Central locking sign turns OFF to reflect locked state.  
5. **Seatbelt Use**:  
   - Driver manually fastens the seatbelt.  
   - Seatbelt warning indicator turns OFF.  
6. **Vehicle Acceleration**: Simulates dynamic driving conditions before crash.  
7. **Crash Simulation**:  
   - Airbag is deployed based on triggering logic.  
   - Speedometer freezes at the last speed value before impact.  
   - Airbag dashboard indicator stays ON post-deployment to signify activation.
